ABOUT LEOS
================================================================================

    LEOS is a software that was created under ISA Action 2016.38 Legislation 
Interoperability Tools - LegIT to address the need of the public administration 
and European Institutions to generate draft legislation in a legal XML format. 
    
    It is a legislation editor and this current prototype supports the drafting 
of the 'secondary' legislation of the EU law which has to be adopted under the 
Ordinary Legislative Procedure. 

    Therefore, it covers the writing of Proposals for Directive, Decision and 
Regulation submitted by the Commission to the Council and the Parliament.

    If you want to find out more about this procedure, please read the European 
Parliament's article.
europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers

    Given the high diversity of legislative traditions encountered across the 
Union and the different levels of modernisation, it was extremely difficult to 
provide a universal single turnkey ICT solution that adapts to each specific 
context.

    Even if a significant part of the business logic can be found embedded in 
the code, we design with the goal of delivering re-usable building blocks so 
LEOS is released Open Source as we believe that some parts of it could be reused
and adapted by some other Public Administration having similar needs.

    For more information on the features please follow us on Joinup:
joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/leos-open-source-software-editing-legislation

    The code is available for free under EUPL licence, and the development team 
paid attention to organise the code in a structured way to ease its reusability 
(modules, plugins…).

    The LEOS demo provided in our release comes with an example user interface 
that includes the logo of the European Commission. 
This is just for demonstration purpose and please note that the logo of the 
European Commission may be used by third parties only if:
-  Permission is requested and granted before the logo is used
-  There is no likelihood of the user of the logo being confused with the 
European Commission
-  It is not used in connection with objectives or activities which are 
incompatible with the aims and principles of the European Commission
-  It is not used to imply or suggest unintended endorsement or promotion of the
objectives and activities of the user of the logo by the European Commission

WHAT'S NEW?
================================================================================
What’s new?
This Beta version is currently used for a pilot across the Commission services. 
The main differences compared to the previous prototype version are:
-  Acts are managed as a set of elements (explanatory memorandum, legal text, 
annexes…) and global metadata are propagated across sub-elements
-  Improved version management, with major versions and possibility to see 
differences between versions
-  Import feature, enabling to import some content already published in the 
Official Journal of the EU
-  New security layer
-  Support of images
-  Improved table of content edition
-  Possible to add comments & highligts using annotations
-  Possible to add suggestions on a part of text with the feature to accept and 
reject a suggestion


WHAT'S GONE?
================================================================================
What’s gone?
Note that some features of the prototype were removed :
- The locking of the edited area and the notifications mechanism have not been 
retained because judged too cumbersome; it might come back under another form
- The pdf rendering is now delegated to a service external to the project 
- Feedback view is removed as workflows are not part of system


GET IN TOUCH
================================================================================

    We are envisaging to create an open source community on software for 
legislation drafting, in order to share best practices, experiences, expertise, 
and why not code!!
Should you be interested or would you just like to share with us some 
observations on our work, you can join the conversation one legislative drafting
here

OR contact us at DIGIT-LEOS-FEEDBACK@ec.europa.eu .

We are looking forward to hearing from you,
