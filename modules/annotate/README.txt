ANNOTATE APPLICATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Annotate 
This application is divided in three parts 
1)  client
2)  server
3)  config

CLIENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Client part is an angular application which runs in the scope of another webapp 
    to provide annotation functionality.


SERVER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Server part is an API server which expose an API for client to consume and also 
    serves static(client) files.

CONFIG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contains configuration property files.


DEVELOPMENT OF SERVER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisite
1) Maven 3.3.9+
2) JDK 1.8_0_151+
3) Maven should have internet connectivity. You may have to add proxy in maven 
    settings.xml and {annotate}\client\.npmrc
4) TOMCAT 8.5.20 or weblogic 12.1.3
5) If Eclipse is used as development IDE, Oxygen release is recommended as it 
    supports the Tomcat server version mentioned.


COMPILING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) UNZIP the Zip in folder henceforth referred as {annotate}

2) Check or modify the database that should be used by the server application.

   To do so, set the according profile in file {annotate}\config\src\main\filters\local.properties file:   
   - if you want to use H2 in-memory database, set
        annotate.db=h2
   - if you want to use Oracle database, set
        annotate.db=oracle

    Inside folder {annotate}\config\src\main\resources:
    - if you want to use H2 in-memory database no needed any change here.
    - if you want to use Oracle database.
        1. Rename file 'anot-h2.properties' to 'anot-oracle.properties'.
        2. Remove all content in this file and add the following:
            #Basic Spring Boot Config for Oracle
            spring.datasource.jndi-name=jdbc/leosDB
            spring.datasource.driver-class-name=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
            spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect
        3. Save changes.

3) To compile run the following command in {annotate}
    $ mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
    It will generate appropriate configuration files values from property files.

4) Now, on successful finish, WAR file would be visible in {annotate}/server/target
    folder.

5) This WAR file can be deployed in TOMCAT, Weblogic or any other application 
    server.


DB SETUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) For H2
    If you want to use H2 in-memory database, there is nothing more to do here.
    The H2 database is initialized automatically during deployment step using 
    the schema script file located at 
        {annotate}/server/src/main/resources/schema-h2.sql
    and filled with required data from the 
        {annotate}/server/src/main/resources/data-h2.sql

B) For Oracle
    If you want to use Oracle database, however, the database schema needs to be 
    created initially. Appropriate scripts for the creation of all required elements
    like tables, triggers, sequences, ... are found at 
        {annotate}/server/src/scripts/db/consolidated/schema-oracle.sql
    1) Log in to your database and run these scripts, making sure you have  
        appropriate permissions to create these objects (CREATE SEQUENCE,  
        CREATE TABLE and CREATE TRIGGER should be sufficient).
    2) Next, some initial configuration needs to be inserted into the database. 
        This data is contained in a script that can be found at
         {annotate}/server/src/scripts/db/consolidated/data-oracle.sql
    3) Log in to your database and run this script.


DEPLOYMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
    - To use Oracle database it is needed to create data source named 'jdbc/leosDB' (this name is referenced
        in 'anot-oracle.properies' file) and configure it against the Oracle database schema to be used for annotate. 


A) For TOMCAT
    1) Deploy the WAR annotate.war in TOMCAT with context root at '/annotate' with port 9099
    2) Welcome page will be available at http://localhost:9099/annotate/app.html

B) For WEBLOGIC
    1) Deploy the WAR annotate.war in Weblogic at port 9099
    2) Welcome page will be available at http://localhost:9099/annotate/app.html


NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) The server can work with Http/https both.
2) Configurable properties are present at following places
    {annotate}/config/src/main/filters/common.properties
    {annotate}/config/src/main/filters/local.properties
    Above-mentioned port 9099 might have to be configured in the 'anot.properties' 
     property file.
3) When using Oracle, you may need to install oracle driver in MAVEN as this is 
    not open source.
4) When using Oracle, an entry for the default group needs to be created in the 
    GROUPS table. The "Name" column of this group needs to coincide to the corres-
    ponding property in common.properties file (defaultgroup.name).
