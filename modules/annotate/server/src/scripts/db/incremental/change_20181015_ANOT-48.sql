------------------------------------
-- Changes to initial Oracle 
-- database creation scripts
--
-- adds a new column on ANNOTATIONS table for status transitions (soft delete),
--   and two auditing columns for status change
-- creates a combined index on columns mostly used for search operations
-- note: we don't update the STATUS_UPDATED field using a trigger as it isn't be supported by H2 and implementations would diverge
--
-- also adds two auditing columns for response status change on METADATA table
-- 
-- change initiated by ANOT-48
