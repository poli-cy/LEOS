                        TABLE OF CONTENT - HOWTO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. By Default, document viewer is divided into two columns. Right-hand side is
	document area and left-hand side is the navigation and version pane. 
	The table of content is a tree that consists of hierarchical structure of 
	the document. The versions pane contains a list of all versions.        
   
2. The tool-bar of the navigation pane consists of two buttons:
      - The expand/collapse button to expand or collapse the tree.
      - The edit button to edit the tree structure. (if you have editing rights)
      
3. To change the document structure, click on the icon with label 
	'Edit document structure inline'. A menu with the elements will open.
   
4. The elements menu consists of the elements that can be added to the tree using 
	'drag n drop'. This feature is bounded by the rules of the document structure,
	so the elements can only be added at a valid level in the hierarchy.
   
5. Once an element is added, at the bottom of the navigation pane, the meta-data 
	section is displayed. It consists of three fields: Type, Number and Heading.
	The 'Heading' field is editable and the rest are read-only. On selection of
	an element from the table of content, these fields are populated. A 'Delete'
	button is also provided to delete an element from the tree if possible.
   
7. After the edition, click on the 'Save' button to save the changes OR on 
	'Save and close' if you also want to exit the edit mode.
	If you want to discard the changes, click the button ‘Cancel’. Once you click, 
	a message with two options will be displayed:
      - ‘Close without saving’
      - ‘Save and close’.
	To close the elements menu click on 'Cancel'.
